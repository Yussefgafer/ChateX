## 📡 How it works

ChateX treats your device as a "Node". When you enter the **Radar**, your device begins:
1. **Advertising:** Broadcasting your spectral presence to others.
2. **Discovery:** Scanning the void for other active nodes.
3. **Linking:** Establishing a private, encrypted-ready socket for direct communication.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open ChateX on two or more Android devices.
2. Grant Nearby Devices and Bluetooth permissions.
3. Watch the **Radar** pulse until nodes appear.
4. Tap a node to start a private spectral session.
